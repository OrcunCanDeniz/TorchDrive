# TorchDrive
###### Work in progress. 

This repository aims to implement [NVIDIA's Behavioral Cloning Paper](https://images.nvidia.com/content/tegra/automotive/images/2016/solutions/pdf/end-to-end-dl-using-px.pdf) using PyTorch. 

As the source of the data [Udacity Self Driving Car Simulator](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim) is utilized since it seamlessly lets gathering the type of data we need. 
 
 ##### Todos:
 - [x] ~~Create Dataset and Dataloaders~~
 - [x] ~~Create model~~
 - [x] ~~Implement Training~~
 
Upcoming todos are going to be followed from issues tab.
